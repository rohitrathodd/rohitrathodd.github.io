Hello there, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Mark Corum and I am a 25 year old accountant turned programmer. 
After getting my degree I decided there was no better time to strike out on my own and try to create my own accounting business.

After a while, I realized that accounting didn't give me that "hands in the dirt" feeling I enjoy.
I never had any experience with coding or IT in general, but the program at Coder Foundry seemed interesting and I gave it a try. 
Now, with their help, I have learned a variety of skills including: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, C# and the .NET framework, and more.

For employers out there, I am excited about the opportunity to develop further, and add value to your organization! 


My core values revolve around being respectful, helpful, optimistic, and result-oriented!
